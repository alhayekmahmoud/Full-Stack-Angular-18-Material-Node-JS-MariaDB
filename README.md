# Full-Stack-Angular-18-Material-Node-JS-MariaDB
 Full Stack project for Client system in which we'll use  Angular 18 as a Frontend and  Node JS as Backend and MariaDB as a Database.  We will first create one database and table in MariaDB Database using HeidiSQL tool which is an user interface for creating database and table for MariaDB database. 
 Full Stack project for Client system in which we'll use  Angular 18 as a Frontend and  Node JS as Backend and MariaDB as a Database. 
We will first create one database and table in MariaDB Database using HeidiSQL tool which is an user interface for creating database and table for MariaDB database. 
Our database will store client related data in Client table.
On the backend side We are going to create Backend application using Node JS and implement all the CRUD functionality using  node JS API.
We will also test our backend API's using Postman and verify results in database side.
On the frontend side we are going to create our angular standalone application using angular version 18 and install angular material library for creating material table.
We can create proxy configuration in angular so that our angular application will communicate with backend application which is running on different port.
Next we will create required  components like module, service, component and interface using ng generate command.
Next we will add routing logic so that It will navigate to home component.
We will create angular material table and populate it with columns and data.
We will implement all the http methods like get, post, put and delete using HttpClient provider in service component. 
We will implement GetMapping method and render returned data in our Material Table.
Next we will implement searching (filter), sorting and pagination functionality with the help of angular material library and apply it on table data to confirm these functionalities are working as expected.
We can integrate our get api data and show returned data on home page along with action buttons like edit and delete on table in home html page.
Next we will use Mat Form Fields and Input Material controls to capture data in input fields and submit the same on click of submit button.
Similar way we can populate Form fields with data on click of edit button in table and update modified data into MariaDB database on click of submit button.
Finally, To remove the Client from table We will implement delete functionality as a part of CRUD Operations.
